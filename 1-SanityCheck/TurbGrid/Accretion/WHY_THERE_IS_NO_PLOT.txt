All these txt files, obtained from the accretion
data of the simulations with different
grid for the turbulence are the same.

What we wanted to see is if something in the
simulations was depending on how the grid was
set up in the beginning. By noticing that
all these files have exactly the same contents
we don't need to make a plot to conclude
that the grid from which turbulence is
generated in the IC has no impact on the 
accreted masses.

A look at the output when making diff 
between snapshots coming from different grids
shows that in the beginning, snapshots are indeed
different, but as evolution stars, the differences
wash out. 
I am not sure that this should be the case.
